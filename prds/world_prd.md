4. Generation Pipeline

A. Generate Province Seeds with Lloyd‚Äôs Relaxation

Why: Random Voronoi seeds yield clumped cells; Lloyd‚Äôs algorithm ensures even, centroidal, more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù province shapes.
	1.	Generate N initial random province seed points.
	2.	For several iterations:
	‚Ä¢	Assign each map cell to nearest seed (Voronoi cell assignment).
	‚Ä¢	For each cell, compute centroid (average (x,y) of all map tiles assigned to that seed).
	‚Ä¢	Move each seed to its centroid.
	3.	Final seeds are the province centers.

Code:

def lloyd_relaxation(width, height, num_seeds, iterations, rng):
    # Step 1: Random initial seeds
    seeds = np.column_stack([
        rng.integers(0, width, num_seeds),
        rng.integers(0, height, num_seeds)
    ])
    for _ in range(iterations):
        province_map = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)
        cell_points = [[] for _ in range(num_seeds)]
        # Assign to nearest
        for y in range(height):
            for x in range(width):
                dists = np.sum((seeds - np.array([x, y]))**2, axis=1)
                p = np.argmin(dists)
                province_map[y, x] = p
                cell_points[p].append((x, y))
        # Move each seed to centroid
        for i in range(num_seeds):
            if cell_points[i]:
                arr = np.array(cell_points[i])
                seeds[i, 0] = int(np.mean(arr[:, 0]))
                seeds[i, 1] = int(np.mean(arr[:, 1]))
    return seeds

Call with e.g. lloyd_relaxation(width, height, num_seeds, 3, np.random.default_rng(seed)).

‚∏ª

B. Assign Provinces & Borders
	1.	For each map tile, assign to nearest seed/site (after relaxation).
	2.	Borders = tiles adjacent to different province.

def assign_provinces(width, height, seeds):
    province_map = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            dists = np.sum((seeds - np.array([x, y]))**2, axis=1)
            province_map[y, x] = np.argmin(dists)
    return province_map

def mark_borders(province_map):
    height, width = province_map.shape
    border_map = np.zeros_like(province_map, dtype=bool)
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            for dy, dx in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                ny, nx = y+dy, x+dx
                if 0<=ny<height and 0<=nx<width and province_map[ny, nx]!=province_map[y, x]:
                    border_map[y, x]=True
    return border_map


‚∏ª

C. Elevation & Ridged Mountains
	‚Ä¢	Use Perlin noise for base elevation.
	‚Ä¢	Add an ‚Äúabsolute value‚Äù Perlin noise for ridged mountains.

‚∏ª

D. Coast Smoothing
	‚Ä¢	After elevation is generated, iteratively smooth low-elevation (coast) tiles for natural coastlines.
	‚Ä¢	(Optional: For each sea tile, average with adjacent elevation to reduce noisy islets.)

‚∏ª

E. Rainfall & Rain Shadow
	‚Ä¢	Generate Perlin noise for base rainfall.
	‚Ä¢	Apply rain shadow algorithm:
	‚Ä¢	For each row (assuming west-to-east wind), track moisture, reduce after crossing high mountains.
	‚Ä¢	Normalize.

‚∏ª

F. Temperature
	‚Ä¢	Temperature = latitude effect (colder at poles) - elevation effect (colder up high)
	‚Ä¢	Normalize.

‚∏ª

G. Water Flow / Flux Map for Rivers
	‚Ä¢	For each cell, count how many upstream cells drain through it (‚Äúwater flux‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Use ‚Äúdownslope neighbor‚Äù for every tile (steepest neighbor).
	‚Ä¢	For each cell, recursively accumulate upstream cell counts.

def compute_water_flux(elevation):
    height, width = elevation.shape
    downslope = np.full((height, width, 2), -1, dtype=int)
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            min_elev = elevation[y,x]
            best = None
            for dy, dx in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                ny, nx = y+dy, x+dx
                if 0<=ny<height and 0<=nx<width and elevation[ny,nx]<min_elev:
                    min_elev = elevation[ny, nx]
                    best = (ny, nx)
            if best:
                downslope[y, x] = best
    # Compute water flux
    water_flux = np.ones((height, width))
    order = [(y,x) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)]
    order.sort(key=lambda p: -elevation[p])  # high to low
    for y, x in order:
        ny, nx = downslope[y, x]
        if ny>=0:
            water_flux[ny, nx] += water_flux[y, x]
    return water_flux, downslope


‚∏ª

H. River Placement and Width
	‚Ä¢	River sources: high water flux and high elevation (not too near sea)
	‚Ä¢	Each river follows downslope map to sea.
	‚Ä¢	As river flows, keep count of flux to set width.

def trace_rivers(water_flux, downslope, elevation, min_flux=20):
    height, width = elevation.shape
    river_map = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)
    river_width = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)
    river_id = 1
    visited = set()
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            if water_flux[y, x] >= min_flux and (y, x) not in visited:
                path = []
                cy, cx = y, x
                while elevation[cy, cx] >= 0.26:
                    if (cy, cx) in visited:
                        break
                    visited.add((cy, cx))
                    path.append((cy, cx))
                    river_map[cy, cx] = river_id
                    river_width[cy, cx] = int(max(1, np.log2(water_flux[cy, cx])))
                    ncy, ncx = downslope[cy, cx]
                    if ncy<0 or elevation[ncy, ncx]<0.26:
                        break
                    cy, cx = ncy, ncx
                river_id += 1
    return river_map, river_width


‚∏ª

I. Biome Assignment
	‚Ä¢	Use elevation, rainfall, and temperature to select biome (see above).

‚∏ª

J. City Placement
	‚Ä¢	One ‚Äúcapital‚Äù per province (choose highest water flux tile on river/coast in province).
	‚Ä¢	Remaining cities: well-spaced, also on rivers/coasts if possible.

def place_cities(province_map, river_map, elevation, n_cities=1, min_dist=10):
    height, width = elevation.shape
    city_coords = []
    for province_id in np.unique(province_map):
        candidates = []
        for y in range(height):
            for x in range(width):
                if province_map[y, x]==province_id and elevation[y, x]>0.26 and elevation[y, x]<0.8:
                    if river_map[y, x]>0 or any(elevation[ny,nx]<0.26 for dy in [-1,0,1] for dx in [-1,0,1] 
                        if 0<=y+dy<height and 0<=x+dx<width for ny,nx in [(y+dy,x+dx)]):
                        candidates.append((y,x))
        # Pick city farthest from others (capital placement)
        if candidates:
            best = max(candidates, key=lambda c: min([np.hypot(c[0]-y, c[1]-x) for y,x in city_coords] or [1e9]))
            city_coords.append(best)
    return city_coords


‚∏ª

K. Road Placement
	‚Ä¢	Use A* or Dijkstra to connect cities, cost = base+elevation*multiplier, prefer valleys, allow bridges.
	‚Ä¢	Record as a bool map.

‚∏ª

L. Final Rendering
	‚Ä¢	Overlay province coloring, borders, rivers (variable width), cities, and roads atop ASCII biomes.
	‚Ä¢	Use blessed for full RGB in terminal.

‚∏ª

5. Rendering Details
	‚Ä¢	Each overlay has distinct glyph and color priority:
	‚Ä¢	City: @, gold
	‚Ä¢	Thick river: ‚â°, blue
	‚Ä¢	Thin river: =, light blue
	‚Ä¢	Border: #, purple
	‚Ä¢	Road: :, brown
	‚Ä¢	Province fill: subtle background color (optional, not always visible in terminals)
	‚Ä¢	Biome: glyph/color as in table

‚∏ª

6. Success Criteria
	‚Ä¢	Provinces have natural, evenly sized/centered shapes (thanks to Lloyd‚Äôs algorithm).
	‚Ä¢	Rivers grow wider with accumulation/tributaries and flow sensibly to sea.
	‚Ä¢	Cities are capitals per province, well distributed and mostly on rivers/coasts.
	‚Ä¢	Roads connect cities, prefer valleys, and avoid mountains when possible.
	‚Ä¢	Everything renders as colored ASCII in terminal, overlays don‚Äôt clash.
	‚Ä¢	Map is reproducible for any seed and config.

‚∏ª

7. Extensibility
	‚Ä¢	Add province names and color fills.
	‚Ä¢	Place ports/farms around cities.
	‚Ä¢	Label rivers and provinces.
	‚Ä¢	Support multi-scale maps (zoom in/out).
	‚Ä¢	Export to PNG or JSON for game use.
